# FLIGHTFAREPREDICTION


This project aims to predict the fare of flights using machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging the Random Forest algorithm. Flight fare prediction is a critical task in the travel industry, assisting travelers in planning their trips effectively by providing estimates of flight costs based on various factors. The dataset utilized for this project is obtained from Kaggle and includes features such as airline information, date of journey, source and destination locations, flight route, departure and arrival times, duration of flight, and total stops. These features serve as inputs to the Random Forest model, which is trained to learn patterns and relationships between the provided features and flight fares.

To utilize this project, first, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Then, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file using pip. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the provided Jupyter notebook Flight_Fare_Prediction.ipynb. This notebook contains the code for training the Random Forest model on the provided dataset and making predictions on flight fares based on user input. Users can adjust the model parameters, input features, and explore different prediction scenarios within the notebook.
